# From Zero to GenLayer: A Beginner’s Guide

## Introduction

Blockchain technology is constantly evolving, and new ideas continue to reshape the way decentralized systems work. One of the most interesting emerging projects in this space is GenLayer — a blockchain that integrates artificial intelligence into smart contract execution.

This guide is written for complete beginners who want to understand what GenLayer is and how to start exploring its ecosystem.

## What Is GenLayer?

GenLayer is a blockchain platform that introduces AI-assisted smart contracts. Traditional smart contracts execute fixed, deterministic code. GenLayer explores the idea of allowing artificial intelligence models to participate in evaluating certain conditions and logic on-chain.

This approach opens possibilities for more flexible and dynamic decentralized applications.

## Why GenLayer Matters

The combination of AI and blockchain is powerful for several reasons:

- AI can help interpret complex data.
- Smart contracts can become more adaptive.
- New types of decentralized applications can be created.
- Decision-making processes can go beyond rigid code.

While the ecosystem is still growing, the concept itself is forward-looking and innovative.

## Step 1: Getting Started

If you are starting from zero, here’s a simple path:

1. Create a crypto wallet (such as MetaMask).
2. Visit the official GenLayer platform.
3. Connect your wallet.
4. Explore the dashboard and available features.

The onboarding process is designed to be simple and user-friendly.

## Step 2: Understanding the Points Program

GenLayer includes a points system to reward early users and contributors. Participants can earn points by:

- Engaging with the platform
- Completing onboarding tasks
- Participating in testnet activities
- Contributing educational or technical content
- Joining the community

This system encourages learning and ecosystem growth.

## Step 3: Exploring the Testnet

After connecting your wallet, you can explore the testnet environment. This may include:

- Interacting with smart contracts
- Testing network features
- Reviewing documentation
- Monitoring transaction responses

Even simple interactions help you better understand how the system works.

## Community and Learning

Like many early-stage blockchain projects, community involvement is important. Joining discussion channels and reading documentation can accelerate your learning process.

As the ecosystem expands, new tools and opportunities are likely to appear.

## Final Thoughts

Starting from zero in blockchain can feel overwhelming. However, GenLayer’s approach makes it accessible for beginners while introducing advanced concepts like AI-integrated smart contracts.

For anyone curious about the future of decentralized technology, GenLayer is a project worth exploring.

This guide was created from a beginner’s perspective to help others take their first steps into the GenLayer ecosystem.
